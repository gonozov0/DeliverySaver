# DeliverySaver
The project was created as a final practical work at the Samsung IOT academy.
This is a service for preserving food and controlling its quality during delivery by couriers.
It is assumed that the courier bag contains a IOT device that will transmit data to the server.
Here is a server-side implementation of the project, written in the ASP.NET Core framework and using a small frontend with bootstrap framework.
